              <p>• Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br>
                Responsive design is an approach in HTML and CSS that allows the developers to design their websites and applications for various devices such as cellphones, desktops, and tablets. By using responsive design, we can develop websites that automatically adjust the website’s content and sections to match the client-side screen size. All in all, the term responsive means to make that design adaptable and responsive across all the platforms. One way to do this is to use media queries which is a feature of CSS3 that allows us to add certain features and display the content of the website according to screen size, platform, and device resolution.
                <br><br>• How does responsive design relate to web technologies?<br>
                a responsive web design ensures that your site is equally practical on all types of devices and does not lose functionality with newer electronic devices coming to the market in the future. It ensures that you're ready for future technology, avoiding the need for a redesign every time a new device is introduced to the market. Because with a few adjustments, you can make your previous design adjustable to the new device's screen size. In these modern times, we cannot use static design anymore, we need to use this new approach if we want to keep up with the new technologies out in the market.
                <br><br>• What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?<br>
                A web application is a program that is accessible using any web browser. And from my research, I learned that a good web application must be responsive to all platform devices and must also have a user-friendly design. A web app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is used for the front end of the application, we also need to know some backend languages like python, node js, or any other backend languages to be able to build a web application
                <br><br>• Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br>
                In this course, we started with the JavaScript language which is among one of the most popular languages and is used to program the behavior of the webpages. We got familiar with the syntax of the JavaScript language and then moved on to the Document object model and query selectors which allowed us to update and change the content of the HTML and CSS files dynamically by writing functions in a separate script file and accessing them by name, id, etc. Java script has lots of built-in functions which makes coding easier and error-free for programmers. Then we moved on to HTML and learned the traditional way of coding with HTML and how to use CSS to design the website and make it responsive. With HTML, first, we would build the structure of the website, and then using CSS we would design it and make it user-friendly. We can use different fonts, colors, styles, and lots of other features in CSS to make our website unique and nice. And finally, with JavaScript, we could add functionality to our websites. We finished the course by learning about the HTML forms and how to use input element attributes or Javascript to validate the user input contents.
